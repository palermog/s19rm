# I. Leading Class Discussion

Once during the semester you will be responsible for leading our class discussion. This means a few things:

1. You should read all the readings—including the optional readings—for your week carefully and well in advance.
2. You may also tweak our readings for your week by adding one additional article and possibly moving one required reading into the optional category. You should speak with me well in advance about either, as I might see something essential in a piece that is not obvious to you. Any decision to change the reading schedule should be made at least one week prior to your assigned session, so that your colleagues have time to adjust their preparations.
3. You should come to your assigned class ready with a few questions or points you would like to discuss. I do not expect you to steer us for the entire discussion period, but certainly for the first 20 minutes or so.

# II. Fieldbooks

"Reading Machines" is an experiential course that moves between discussion of readings and applied "humanities laboratories" each week. A central goal of the class will be to bring its two facets into conversation: to use our readings and discussions to contextualize our applied work in laboratories, and to use our applied work in laboratories to enrich our understanding of concepts from our readings. 

To help accomplish this goal, you will maintain a fieldbook, which will constitute your central scholarly activity throughout this semester. I call this assignment a "fieldbook" rather than a "journal" to convey its hybridity: week by week, your entries will include a mix of description, analysis, code, figures, or images. This ongoing assignment will give you the chance to organize the diverse tasks of the class' experiential work, practice the skills introduced in the labs, bring your experiential work into conversation with class readings and personal research, and experiment with ideas that will be further developed in your seminar unpaper (see below). 

There will be two types of entries in your fieldbooks: **bibliographic annotation** and **lab report**.  

## Bibliographic Annotation Entries

In order to help you attend closely to our course texts and prepare for each class, you should prepare a few paragraphs responding to the core readings and your chosen penumbral text. I mean a few paragraphs **in total**, *NOT* a few paragraphs per text. Your entries should synthesize and bring readings into conversation, and should focus on a few ideas you want to highlight rather than attempting to summarize everything in the readings. These entries should be prepared, roughly, in the style of the annotated bibliography. It will be easiest to complete this assignment if you jot down notes and ideas while reading.  

You should draft each bibliographic annotation fieldbook entry in its own `.md` file, following the naming convention outlined above, and commit it to your fieldbook repository prior to the pertinent class period. *To emphasize: each class preparation entry should be saved as a separate file in your Github repository.*

## Lab Report Entries

Your lab report entries will vary quite a bit from lab to lab. I may post a prompt for a lab to help start your thinking, in which ase you should begin your reports from these prompts. 

In each lab report entry, I will expect to find a brief  description of the lab activities completed and any outcomes (code, a material product, etc.). For coding labs, you will likely integrate code snippets directly into your Markdown file (more on this as those labs approach), while for other labs you may instead reference external proof of your work, such as photos. I will also expect prose that reflects analytically on the work of the lab, putting it into conversation with *one or two* readings *from the same week of class* as the lab, as well as readings drawn from the larger class or beyond where appropriate. This prose need not be quite as formal as a research paper, but it should demonstrate careful thought and preparation. You should integrate the readings explicitly, if possible through direct quotation. Use this writing to experiment with intellectual pairings you think might be generative to your larger thinking and help you prepare for the class' Unessay projects.

## Organizing Your Fieldbook

Your fieldbook will be a collection of Markdown or `.md` files collected in a [Github Repository](https://github.com/). We will learn how to write in Markdown and contribute to a Github repository during the first laboratory (which you will reflect on in your first lab report). You will share the address of your repository with me so that I can check your progress. I may also ask to repost stellar fieldbook entries on our class website, either under your name or anonymously as you prefer.

You should name your files following the following convention:

*For bibliographic nnnotation entries:*

`YYYY-MM-DD-bibliographic-WHAT-WORDS-YOU-WANT.md`

*For lab report entries:*

`YYYY-MM-DD-labreport-WHAT-WORDS-YOU-WANT.md`

### Flexibility

Reading Machines is a challenging and full class. The semester will include thirteen weeks of readings and eleven or twelve humanities laboratories. To give you some flexibility, you may choose to forgo bibliographic annotation entries twice during the semester, and you should plan to complete seven lab report entries. I strongly recommend you not delay starting this work, but instead begin early and work steadily so that you can use this flexibility as the inevitable stresses of the semester emerge. Your bibliographic annotation entries are due prior to the pertinent class, while lab report entries are due within two weeks of the pertinent lab session.

# Dead Media Poster

In [“Imagining the New Media Encounter,"](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405148641/9781405148641.xml&chunk.id=ss1-3-1&toc.depth=1&toc.id=ss1-3-1&brand=9781405148641_brand) Alan Liu suggests that “The déjá vu haunting of new by old media is clear enough.” New technologies and new modes of communication draw, both technically and metaphorically, from older modes—including “dead media” that have, to all surface appearances, entirely disappeared.

To better understand this haunting, you will work in pairs to research a historical new medium and/or technology that flourished and then faded from popular view: some might call this [“media archaeology”](http://mediaarchaeologylab.com/). These new media might be very old or relatively new: new textual technologies have emerged since the invention of writing, while some popular technologies introduced as recently as a decade ago are already obsolete. 

## How 'Dead' is Dead?

I would ask that you employ a relatively strict, but not pedantic, definition of “dead media”: it should mean less than “completely and totally banished from human culture” and more than “no longer hip.” To put this idea another way: a small community of dedicated enthusiasts should not rescue a technology from being called “dead media,” but neither should we prematurely kill off a medium that is still in wide use, even if cutting edge users have moved on (think CDs, perhaps).

## Resources for Finding a Medium

You might consider this list from the original [Dead Media Project](http://www.deadmedia.org/notes/index-numeric.html) or from the [Dead Media Archive](http://cultureandcommunication.org/deadmedia/index.php/Main_Page) as you plan your topic. When choosing your medium, opt for the unfamiliar and the strange if at all possible—try to find a medium you suspect your colleagues have never heard of, or perhaps one they will *think* they know until its reality surprises them.

## The Poster

You will prepare a conference-style poster to present your “dead medium” to your classmates and instructor. If you’ve never created a research poster, consult the references on [the “poster session” Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poster_session) for writing and design tips. Your poster should address on the following questions:

1. How did this medium innovate, diverge, or respond to even earlier media? What precisely was new about it when it was the “new media?” Remember that for contemporanous people, these media were every bit as strange, exciting, or terrifying as the most cutting edge advances are to us today.
2. What were the cultural effects of this medium during its heyday? Did it produce substantive changes in domestic life, politics, art, or other spheres? Were there cultural changes its creators sought, either successfully or unsuccessfully, to institute through the medium?
3. Were there competing media that attempted to meet the same needs or fill the same niche as your chosen medium? How did this competition play out?
4. How and why did your medium decline in importance?
5. What were the lasting effects or products of your medium? Was it a media “dead end” or did new media evolve from it? How does your medium linger in descendants, images, memory, or language?

You should not attempt on your poster to tell us everything that you might say about your chosen medium in a written paper nor explain its every nuance. When designing think CONCISE, INFORMATIVE, and CREATIVE. Students often choose to create a model or interactive aspect to their poster to help their colleagues understand their medium. The idea here is that the form’s restriction (paradoxically) promotes your creativity, as some might argue the formal restrictions of certain poetic forms force the poet toward ever-more-deft feats of language. You will have ample opportunity during the poster session to share more details and anecdotes from your research than you can fit onto your poster itself.

**We will hold our “dead media” poster session in the lab section of class on January 30.**

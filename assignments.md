# Leading Class Discussion

Once during the semester you will be responsible for leading our class discussion. This means a few things:

1. You should read all the readings—including the optional readings—for your week carefully and well in advance.
2. You may also tweak our readings for your week by adding one additional article and possibly moving one required reading into the optional category. You should speak with me well in advance about either, as I might see something essential in a piece that is not obvious to you. Any decision to change the reading schedule should be made at least one week prior to your assigned session, so that your colleagues have time to adjust their preparations.
3. You should come to your assigned class ready with a few questions or points you would like to discuss. I do not expect you to steer us for the entire discussion period, but certainly for the first 20 minutes or so.

# Fieldbooks

"Reading Machines" is an experiential course defined by hands-on labs throughout the semester. Some of these activities will be conducted individually and some in groups.

Your fieldbook will constitute your central scholarly activity during the semester. I call this assignment a "fieldbook" rather than a "journal" to convey its intellectual seriousness and hybridity: your entries will include a mix of description, analysis, code, and figures or images. This ongoing assignment will give you the chance to organize the diverse tasks of the class' experiential work, practice the skills introduced in the labs and coding sessions, bring your experiential work into conversation with class readings and personal research, and experiment with ideas that will be further developed in your final projects. 

## Organizing Your Fieldbook

Your fieldbook will comprise at least 6 entries over the course of the semester, each composed as a Markdown or `.md` file, perhaps including supplemental files such as images referenced in the documents. We will work on setting this up in our first class lab on day one, so it's okay if you do not understand precisely what this means right now. Your fieldbooks will be posted to the [Class Updates](/updates/) section of the course website. Think of these entries as an evolving research paper: they have the same weight and seriousness. 

## Composition

You will have significant leeway in how you write your fieldbook entries. I want you to use this space to think through the relationship of praxis and theory in our course, and to apply the ideas of the course to your own research interests. However, there are a few elements I will expect in each entry:

1. Prose that both describes the work done in the lab and reflects analytically on that work. This prose need not be as formal as a research paper, but it should demonstrate careful thought and preparation. You should integrate our course readings into these reflections, often through direct quotation. Use your fieldbooks to explore ideas from the readings that you found particularly interesting, and especially ideas we did not have time to discuss in class. Use this writing to experiment with intellectual pairings you think might be generative to your larger thinking and help you prepare for your seminar project.

2. A header that will allow me to publish your fieldbook easily on the course website and makes clear precisely which lab activity a given entry records. We will go over this header in our first lab, but I've included a model below you can simply copy, paste, and modify. As an example, you might include the following lines at the top of each file (or each entry if you're using a single file), modified to suit the specifics of each week:
    ``` 
    ---
    layout: post
    title: YOUR TITLE HERE
    author: YOUR NAME HERE
    ---
    ```
3. The filename must also follow a very specific convention in order to post correctly. Essentially, it lists the date (of submission) in Year, Month, Date format, followed by your last name (or pseudonym) and some words, which may include the lab number or words from your title. Essentially, it should look like this: `YYYY-MM-DD-NAME-LAB-NUMBER.md`.

## Flexibility

"Reading Machines" will be a challenging and full class. The semester will include 12 labs. To give you some flexibility, you must complete a fieldbook entry for 6 labs over the semester. You may complete more than 6 entries over the semester if you wish.

## Pacing Your Field Work

Your fieldbook should be a developing record of your thinking about our class and its activities. Thus you should be working on it steadily, responding to the labs in a timely manner, in part to keep your thinking fresh and in part to avoid falling too far behind as new labs approach. Unless otherwise noted, a fieldbook entry is due within 2 weeks of the associated lab session. 

# Dead Media Poster

In “Imagining the New Media Encounter," Alan Liu suggests that “The déjá vu haunting of new by old media is clear enough.” New technologies and new modes of communication draw, both technically and metaphorically, from older modes—including “dead media” that have, to all surface appearances, entirely disappeared. To better understand this haunting, you will work in pairs to research a historical new medium and/or technology that flourished and then faded from popular view: some might call this [“media archaeology”](http://mediaarchaeologylab.com/). These new media might be very old or relatively new: new textual technologies have emerged since (at least) the invention of writing, while some popular technologies introduced only a few years ago are already obsolete. 

## How 'Dead' is Dead?

I would ask that you employ a relatively strict, but not pedantic, definition of “dead media”: it should mean less than “completely and totally banished from human culture” and more than “no longer hip.” To put this idea another way: a tiny community of dedicated enthusiasts should not rescue a technology from our calling it “dead media,” while still-widely-accessible technology ignored by cutting edge users (think CDs, perhaps) should escape the label “dead media” for the purposes of this assignment. 

## Resources for Finding a Medium

You might consider this list from the original [Dead Media Project](http://www.deadmedia.org/notes/index-numeric.html) or from the [Dead Media Archive](http://cultureandcommunication.org/deadmedia/index.php/Main_Page) as you plan your topic. When choosing your medium, opt for the unfamiliar and the strange if at all possible—try to find a medium you suspect your classmates have never heard of, or perhaps one they will *think* they know until its reality surprises them.

## The Poster

You and your partner will prepare a conference-style poster to present your “dead medium” to your classmates and instructors. If you’ve never created a research poster, consult the references on [the “poster session” Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poster_session) for writing and design tips. Your poster should address on the following questions:

1. How did this medium innovate, diverge, or respond to even earlier media? What precisely was new about it when it was the “new media?”
2. What were the cultural effects of this medium during its heyday? Did it produce substantive changes in domestic life, politics, art, or other spheres?
3. Were there competing media that attempted to meet the same needs or fill the same niche as your chosen medium?
4. How and why did your medium decline in importance?
5. What were the lasting effects or products of your medium? Was it a media “dead end” or did new media evolve from it? How does your medium linger in descendants, images, or language?

You should not attempt on your poster to tell us everything that you might say about your chosen medium in a written paper nor explain its every nuance. When designing think CONCISE, INFORMATIVE, and CREATIVE. The idea here is that the form’s restriction (paradoxically) promotes your creativity, as some might argue the formal restrictions of certain poetic forms force the poet toward ever-more-deft feats of language.

**We will hold our “dead media” poster session in the lab section of class on January 30.**

We will soon be adding our first project documents to this site: data reports written by each of the project's national teams. These reports will survey the historical newspaper data available in our countries—as well as some freely available from other regions of the world—and provide a unique, transnational perspective on digitized historical newspapers, their availability, and their formats. We hope these reports will constitute an early contribution from the OcEx project to the wider digital humanities community, as well as any researchers interested in transnational periodicals research.

This class will be a bit different from most of your graduate classes. I hope you will see these differences as exciting and intellectually stimulating, but you should be aware of the following caveats as we begin (and thanks to Miriam Posner for [writing the first draft](http://dh201.humanities.ucla.edu/2013/#why) of these caveats for her DH grad course):

If you can face these challenges with persistence, verve, and (reasonably) good humor, we should have an intellectually enlivening semester. If you have any concerns about these caveats, please come talk to me. I am confident we can find a way forward if we work together. 

## 1. The course will itself be an experiment.

The concepts and structure of "Reading Machines" emerged from my experiences teaching experiential book and media history to undergraduates; my own experiences—alongside faculty, librarians, and graduate students—with hands-on archival work and instruction through organizations such as the [Rare Book School](https://rarebookschool.org/) and the [Digital Humanities Summer Institute](http://dhsi.org); and my growing conviction that theory and praxis must be intertwined in scholarly discussions of historical and contemporary technologies. This course will focus on inscription technologies, which we will come to understand through a range of readings *and* hands-on "book labs" in class. 

An experimental course such as this opens itself up to many quirks: the syllabus may shift; a given tool might not work as expected; an experiment might veer off track or fail altogether. In other words, this course will require both an innovative spirit and patience from its students.

## 2. You will not produce a final seminar paper.

You will produce a final, (potentially) collaborative project that will ask you to be conscious about relationships among media and messages. Likely this project will require substantial writing, but it will not look like a 20 page seminar paper at semester’s end. Instead, your projects will require sustained work and will be multimodal, comprising text and other elements (e.g. digital images, maps, network graphs). Your projects may be fully digital, fully analog, or some hybrid of the two. These projects may well lead into more established forms of writing or publication, but we will not begin there. 

## 3. You will collaborate (not just do group work).

Digital humanities projects often require collaboration among scholars who bring different intellectual and technical skills to expansive projects. This class will require you to work together both in class and for some of your assignments, distributing responsibilities and sharing credit.

## 4. Your workload and pace may differ from that of your collaborators.

We will do substantial work in teams in this class, and team members will have unique roles to play. Depending on the role you assume, you may be called upon to work with greater intensity earlier (or later) in the semester from some of your teammates or other classmates. I will help guide you through this process, but I cannot guarantee now when you will be busiest this semester. I cannot even guarantee you will do precisely the same amount of work as each of your colleagues. Such are the perils of collaboration.

## 5. You will be required to acquire some technical skills.

While I do not require or assume any particular technical experience as we begin this course, I will expect you to be willing to experiment with new tools and learn new technical skills throughout the semester. In this course, those skills will run the gamut from the historical—such as letterpress printing—to the contemporary—such as computer programming. “I’m not very technical” will not excuse you from the hands-on portions of the course any more than “I’m not poetic” would excuse you from reading Dickinson in a survey of American literature. Some of the tools we test you may find useful for your research program; some you will not. But I expect you to try them with enthusiasm and an open mind.

## 6. You will have to work (some of the time) in public.

The digital humanities community prizes experimenting (and sometimes even failing) in public. Working in public allows others to learn from what we do and to offer help when we need it. For this course we will blog in public. Before you commit to this course, make sure you are ready and willing to experiment with your ideas in public. While I think such an experiment will reward the risks it entails, I recognize that some might not be willing to venture into public scholarship.

## A Note on the Schedule:

Each week there are readings listed under *Core* and *Cenumbra*. The core readings are just that: central to the week's discussion and lab. You should read these closely and prepare to discuss them. The penumbral readings include some of the many brilliant pertinent readings I could not include because time is, sadly, finite. I encourage you to read them and feel free to bring insights from them to class, but I do not strictly require you to read them. In the week you lead class you should definitely prepare both the core and penumbral readings, and if you choose to dig into one of these topics for an assignment the penumbral readings are the first place you can start expanding your thinking.

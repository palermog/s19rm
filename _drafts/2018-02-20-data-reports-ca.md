[Chronicling America](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/) provides an aggregated, public portal to historical newspapers from the United States, collected under the the [National Digital Newspaper Program](http://www.loc.gov/ndnp/), a collaboration between the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Library of Congress. Newspapers have been digitized from the years 1789-1963, though the bulk of the collection comes from the nineteenth century—indeed, especially from around 1850 on—to around 1922, the date commonly considered the US copyright boundary. Indeed, of the 2,576 titles available in Chronicling America as of April 2018, only 8 titles include issues from the decades 1780-1790, and only 24 titles reach into the decades 1930-1960.

Newspaper Overview as of April 2018:

+ 2,576 distinct historical newspaper titles (which can, however, include multiple title changes in a largely stable paper as separate titles)
+ 13,286,065 historical newspaper pages
+ Page images are provided in PDF and JPG2 through the web interface. Additionally, archive-quality TIFF facsimiles can be requested from the Library of Congress
+ OCR-derived, page-level text data is provided in both TXT and XML formats
+ Titles available at <http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/newspapers.txt>

## Data quality

The images digitized through the NDNP and made available through Chronicling America (see “Collection History” below) are the highest-quality images that could be made given the technical restrictions at the time of digitization and the quality of the original microfilm scanned. The highest-resolution images are the archive-quality TIFF files, which are large and must be requested directly from the Library of Congress. The PDF and JPG files served through the project’s web interface are derivatives from the TIFF files.

The OCR data varies widely by state awardee, date of digitization, quality of source pages (or the source microfilm of those pages), and title. In some cases, however, OCR quality varies widely even within a given title, possibly due to changes in the source newspapers, which themselves changed rapidly over the course of the nineteenth century, and possibly due to other factors such as the quality of the original preserved materials. The quality of the OCR data is so variable, in fact, that it is nearly impossible to summarize here.

## Data Availability & Legal Restrictions Concerning the Data

Chronicling America’s data and metadata can be accessed through [the site’s API](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/). The Library of Congress also provides [access to bulk data](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/#bulk-data), which can be retrieved through web crawling tools. Chronicling America includes Atom and JSON feeds to assist in retrieving bulk data.

## Metadata Structure

## Collection History

Chronicling America is a portal that provides access to newspapers digitized under the [National Digital Newspaper Program](http://www.loc.gov/ndnp/) or NDNP, which is in turn an outgrowth of the United States Newspaper Program. The USNP worked from 1982-2011 to identify, describe, and preserve historical newspaper collections, often through microfilming. The NDNP builds on this work and is, in essence, a grant program through which groups can apply for funding to select and digitize “approximately 100,000” newspaper pages representing that state. These papers are mostly scanned from the microfilm editions created under the USNP, which can be scanned more quickly than paper copies. In each NDNP grant, the applicants develop a plan for digitization that determines what a representative group of newspapers might comprise for their state. In some cases states strive for geographic spread (i.e. a selection of newspapers drawn from different geographic parts of the state) and in other cases states focus on digitizing papers that reflect aspects of population such as race, ethnicity, or language. To date, not all states have participated in the NDNP, so there are notable geographic gaps in coverage state-by-state across the US. Other states have received 2 or 3 rounds of funding through the NDNP and thus have significantly more than 100,000 total pages from their states digitized. Until July 2016, the NDNP helped states digitize newspapers published between 1836-1922, but [they now allow digitization of papers between 1690-1963](https://www.neh.gov/news/expanding-our-current-scope-ndnp).
